* key bindings
** Projectile mode

C-c p f - file file
C-c p c - build project
C-c p t - toggle build/test

`which-key` mode is installed, so partially typing a key and waiting for auto
completion would also work.

** general

M-.     - find definition
M-,     - return to previous location
C-c .   - show type for the expression at the cursor
C-c C-c - compile
